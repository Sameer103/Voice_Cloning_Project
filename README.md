This project is aimed at creating a voice cloning model using deep learning techniques. The model can be used to generate speech that sounds like a specific person's voice. The project is hosted on Github and is open-source, meaning anyone can contribute to the development of the model.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository onto your local machine. Once you have done that, you can follow the instructions in the README file to set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the voice cloning model:

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.0+
- Librosa
- NumPy
- SciPy
- tqdm
- Unidecode
- Soundfile

## Usage

To use the voice cloning model, you will need to provide a sample of the person's voice you want to clone. Once you have done that, you can follow the instructions in the README file to generate speech that sounds like that person's voice.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the development of this project, you can fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. Please make sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the README file.
